# Automated-Feature-Detection-of-Aerial-Imagery-
This is a World Bank Challenge project. 
We did the first half challenge which is to preprocess each tree from the image and
fit Convolutional Neural Networks classifier with 87% accuracy, 
Linear Support Vector Machines with 73% accuracy and Logistic Regression model with 68% accuracy.
It contains the challange problem and the code to fit the model as well as the writeup. 

"Presentation.ipynb" is CNN method and "Spark method" is using SVM.
